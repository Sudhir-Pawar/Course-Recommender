# Courses and Student Programs Recommender System.
## Abstract: 
Students or learners tend to prefer online courses, educational blogs for learning a new technology or a programming language. But there are often many courses offered by different platforms like Coursera, Udemy, Educative.etc focusing on the same area learners might be interested in, and choosing the best among them can be an elusive task. The same goes for blogs, finding a useful and worthy reading blog from different blogging sites can be a bit exhausting too. Several companies like AWS, Github etc. provide various benefits to student developers like free access to paid courses, cloud services and  many more benefits but most students are unaware of these privileges. It would be effective if there was some platform which can review and rate courses, blog and also give information about the benefits provided to  students.

## Idea: 
Aim is to build a web portal where learners are made aware of courses, blogs  available on multiple platforms which can be reviewed and rated by other fellow learners. When a learner looks for learning a particular technology related most rated courses can be seen in decreasing order of their rating. Similarly related and most rated blogs are made available to learners along with courses. Student Program or other benefits provided by companies can be listed so that students and learners can avail benefits out of it.<br/>
